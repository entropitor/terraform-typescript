Things to do:
- Allow importing of a resource
- Write acceptence tests?
    Helps with making sure everything works
- Write a real provider (e.g. kong, split.io)
- Strip out extra properties not provided in schema. If not in schema, don't pass to terraform (like ExactRecord from io-ts)
- Finish up all properties (not only list but also set, ...)
- Write acceptence test framework
    Use jest runner?
    Use bash?
    Compatible with only 1 terraform version or multiple?
